# Rutgers: CS550 - Massive Data Mining

## Course Overview
This repository contains the homework assignments completed as part of the Massive Data Mining course during my Master of Science in Computer Science at Rutgers University. The course focused on algorithms and techniques to store, process, mine, analyze, and synthesize large-scale streaming data or data at rest that does not fit in Random Access Memory. The course also covered various massive data applications, including recommendation systems, social networks, stream data mining, and machine learning.

## Course Goals
- Learn algorithms for processing and analyzing streaming data and large-scale data that exceeds RAM capacity.
- Understand and implement algorithms used in various massive data applications.
- Gain hands-on experience with big data technologies like Apache Spark and Python for data mining and machine learning tasks.
